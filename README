postgres jdbc does not support select in batch. this drives me crazy as it makes call a bunch of functions/store procedures so inefficiently.

REASON:
as i need to implement upsert in version 8.2, I wrote a upsert function on db side.
and i also need to call it repeatedly. the performance will be unacceptable without batching on select.
